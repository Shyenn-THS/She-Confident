                Self-confidence is easy to spot but hard to develop. You build
                it piece by piece starting with noticing what you already have
                and appreciating your wins, no matter how small. It doesn’t
                happen overnight. Confidence is a belief in oneself, the
                conviction that one has the ability to meet life's challenges
                and to succeed—and the willingness to act accordingly.

              <p className="">
                Comparing yourself to someone you think is doing better than you
                can cause you to beat yourself up, judge yourself, or feel bad
                about yourself. It’s never a good idea to compare yourself to

                We all want to be successful in our goals but along the journey
                to reaching our big and ambitious goals, we can feel demotivated
                sometimes. This is why celebrating small wins along the way is
                so important in giving us motivation to push through
                difficulties and move forward.

                By embracing failure, you are accepting yourself and your
                situation as a part of life. It is an opportunity for growth,
                but it is not a measure of your future or self-worth.

                Self-respect is loving yourself and treating yourself with care.
                It’s the result of staying true to your values and not being
                willing to compromise. The more you engage in behaviors
                consistent with your beliefs and values, the more you’ll feel

                By chasing your dreams and finding that passion and drive, you
                will be happier in all aspects of life. Your workplace attitude

              Building your confidence takes time and involves plenty of ups and
              downs. As you put in the work toward being confident, here are a
              few tips to keep in mind during virtual meets:
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4  font-medium">
              1. Pay attention to how you frame yourself on screen{' '}
            </p>
            <p className="">
              Virtual meetings allow you to decide how much you want to be
              visible to the other meeting attendees. It would be perfect if you
              could frame your image in a way that shows your shoulders, torso,
              and hands — and not just your head.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4  font-medium">2. Avoid touching the face</p>
            <p className="">
              {' '}
              Rubbing your eyes, covering your mouth, or playing with your hair
              shows you're nervous. Try raising your eyebrows to show interest.
              If you want to show that you agree with what your coworker is
              saying, lightly nod your head in agreement. Your hands shouldn’t
              come near your face — keep them on your lap, or take notes to keep
              them busy (and do something useful).{' '}
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4  font-medium">
              3. Look at the camera, not the screen{' '}
            </p>
            <p className="">
              {' '}
              The proper conduct is to look at the camera because you want to
              simulate looking into your coworkers’ eyes. Since looking at the
              camera lens doesn’t feel natural, when talking during meetings,
              maybe you could alternate between looking directly at the camera
              and the computer screen, at your coworkers.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4  font-medium">
              4. Pay attention to your facial expressions
            </p>
            <p className="">
              Speaking of smiling, during virtual meetings, you should avoid
              frowning, yawning, staring, or other facial expressions that might
              indicate hostility or boredom.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4  font-medium">
              5. Be mindful of your hand gestures
            </p>
            <p>
              {' '}
              If you want to direct the attention of your coworkers to what
              you’re saying, don’t refrain from using your hands while speaking
              to them during virtual meetings. It shows them that you’re
              enthusiastic and engaged in the conversation.
